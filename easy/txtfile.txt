The Road Not Taken - Robert Frost

Two Roads diverged
in a yellow wood
and sorry i could not travel both
and be one traveller long i stood
and looked down one as far as i could


and took the other as just as fair
though as for that the passing by had
really worn them about the same
and both that morning equally lay
though I kept the first for another day
I doubted if I should ever come back
I shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence
I took the one less travelled by
and that has made all the difference.
