                                              The Road Not Taken - Robert Frost
                                                                               
                                                             Two Roads diverged
                                                               in a yellow wood
                                              and sorry i could not travel both
                                              and be one traveller long i stood
                                          and looked down one as far as i could
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                             and took the other as just as fair
                                          though as for that the passing by had
                                                really worn them about the same
                                              and both that morning equally lay
                                        though I kept the first for another day
                                           I doubted if I should ever come back
                                            I shall be telling this with a sigh
                                                  somewhere ages and ages hence
                                               I took the one less travelled by
                                          and that has made all the difference.
